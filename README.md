# Large-Number-Arithmetic
Large number arithmetic using doubly linked list - the implementation of the class LargeInt which uses a dynamic physical structure to store the individual digits of a very large integers, and provide arithmetic operations that can be performed on them. Huge integers may be positive or negative (or zero).
In particular, the class include:
- A default constructor 
- Operator functions to overload the operators +, -, *, /, %
- Operator functions to overload the operators ==, <, <=, >, >=
- An operator function to overload the operator << 
- An operator function to overload the operator >> 

Implementation of the huge integer type encapsulated as a C++ class, aggregating a list object for the internal representation of the huge integer value.
